## ChanceMe@UMich
With increasingly competitive applications, current college admissions criteria are hard to define. ChanceMe@UMich aims to predict a student's chances into the University of Michigan using Machine Learning based on various factors such as academics, extracurricular activities, and demographics. Through an interactive web applciation (coming soon!), prospective students will be able to gauge where they stand in comparison to previously accepted applicants. Based on the 1000+ entries collected, the web application will also provide tips and tricks to improve chances of admission!

## Process

* Collecting the Dataset
* Preprocessing the Data
* Creating an ML Model
* Deploying the ML Model onto a web application


## Languages/Frameworks used
* Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
* Django


## How to use?
The interactive web application is currently construction! We're hoping to roll it out by the end of August!
