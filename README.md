## ChanceMe@UMich
With increasingly competitive applications, current college admissions criteria are hard to define. ChanceMe@UMich aims to predict a student's chances into the University of Michigan using Machine Learning based on various factors such as academics, extracurricular activities, and demographics. Through an interactive web applciation (coming soon!), prospective students will be able to gauge where they stand in comparison to previously accepted applicants. Based on the 1000+ entries collected, the web application will also provide tips and tricks to improve chances of admission!

## Process

* Collecting the Dataset

Since no publicly dataset was available, we had to collect data first-hand (this was the most time-consuming part of the project). We created a survey on Google Forms and surveyed 1000+ students who previously applied to the University of Michigan from 40+ universities across the United States. We reached out to students mainly through University Facebook groups and also through some personal connections. We asked objective questions such as Acceptance Status into University of Michigan, SAT/ACT Score, Class Rank, Gender, Ethnicity, Student Government involvement, etc. (The survey link is posted below! Feel free to take it if you previously applied to the University of Michigan!)
